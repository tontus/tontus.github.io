Title: A cognitive behaviour data analysis on the use of social media in global south context focusing on Bangladesh

Description: In this project, my two teammates and I investigated the human factors that may influence someone to spread misinformation regarding COVID-19 vaccination on social media. After surveying literature from various disciplines, including Philosophy, Psychology, and Computer Science, we formulated several null hypotheses about the pattern of misinformation propagation. We were struggling to find a suitable way to capture the interactions of individuals with fake news. I started reading about other papers to find a way to collect this kind of data. I designed an experiment that can capture and quantify the participants' interactions with a piece of false news in a controlled environment. After collecting some demographic information about the participants, we supplied them with some fabricated news as stimuli about the problems related to COVID-19 vaccines displayed from usually acclaimed sources in Bangladesh. We asked a series of questions related to them. All the survey takers were supplied with the same fabricated news from the same sources to reduce bias. The questions we asked ranged from how it made them concerned about their friends and families to how desperate they were to share these as soon as they finished the survey. We used Likert scales with 7 points to collect data ranging from strongly negative (1) to strongly positive (7). Some examples of the supplied fabricated news are given in Fig. 1 & 2. Those were created by me using Photoshop. Later in the survey, we clarified to the participants that the news was crafted and not actual.
