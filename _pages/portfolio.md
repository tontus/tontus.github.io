## Research Publication

**Title:** A cognitive behaviour data analysis on the use of social media in the global south context focusing on Bangladesh  
**Paper link:** [Read the Paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-30125-w)  
**Role:** Null hypothesis formulation, Survey design, data collection & analysis, writing manuscript  
**Description:** This research is an extension of my undergrad thesis, “Why do we share fake news?”. In this research, my two teammates and I investigated the human factors that may influence someone to spread misinformation regarding COVID-19 vaccination on social media. After surveying literature from various disciplines, including Philosophy, Psychology, and Computer Science, we formulated several null hypotheses about the pattern of misinformation propagation. We designed an experiment to capture and quantify participants' interactions with false news in a controlled environment. We collected demographic information, supplied fabricated news as stimuli, and asked questions related to participants' reactions. Using Likert scales, we collected data and later analyzed it using Python's pandas, numpy, scipy, seaborn, and matplotlib libraries. The research revealed interesting trends, such as individuals spending more than 5 hours per day on social media being more likely to spread false information.

## Presentation

**Title:** Gamification of ICT textbook material to provide an interactive learning experience  
**Venue:** CHI 2023 Virtual Workshop hosted by HCI4SouthAsia (remote)  
**Role:** Idea generation and presentation  
**Description:** Presented a project idea to gamify Bangladesh ICT textbook content, providing an interactive learning experience for underprivileged students. The project focuses on digital literacy, following three learning principles: Interest-powered learning, Peer-supported Learning, and Relevance of learning content. The game simulates a real-life scenario, encourages peer collaboration, and ensures the content aligns with students' coursework.

## Software Development

### Scale Kuwait

**Title:** Scale Kuwait  
**Technology and tools used:** Django (Python) for the backend, Flutter (Dart) for mobile apps, PostgreSQL for the database, Docker for DevOps, React (JavaScript) for the website frontend, and RESTful API.  
**Links:** [Website](website_link), [Mobile Apps - Android](android_app_link), [Mobile Apps - iOS](ios_app_link)  
**Role:** Designing the software architecture and developing the whole software, including deployment  
**Description:** A food delivery startup project where I designed the software architecture and developed the entire system. The backend follows a RESTful architecture pattern, and mobile apps are built using Flutter. An admin dashboard, made with React, is used for internal management. A testing environment has been set up to test new features before making them public. Docker is used for deployment, and automation is implemented for seamless deployment.
