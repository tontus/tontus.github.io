Hi! I'm a `physics` graduate from Shahjalal University of Science and Technology (SUST) with a second major in `computer science and engineering`. From the intricate laws governing the cosmos to the algorithms shaping the digital world, my interest lies in understanding the underlying principles of nature and the universe. I am interested in uncover the meaningful pattern in areas of Physics and human behavior using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I am also interested in the application of AI in the field of computational social science and Physics.

**My research interests include:** `Human Computer Interaction`, `Computational Physics`, `Artificial Intelligence`, `Computational Social Science`, `Computational Astronomy`

I am software developer by profession, working at [Scale Kuwait](https://scale-kuwait.com) as a full stack developer. I am responsible for developing and maintaining the company's website and web applications and also their internal tools and services.  

I'm into literature, art, history, and cinema! Love traveling and [capturing nature's beauty](/photography/) whenever I can.
